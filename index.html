  <p class="center">Hello! My name is Morely Spenser Sherman. I am a graduate mechanical engineering student
    at Sungkyunkwan University. I received my B.S. in MechE. from the Georgia Institute of
    Technology in 2015. My research is in biomimetic applications in aerodynamics and computational
    fluid dynamics (CFD).</p><br>

    <p>My mother was an elementary school librarian throughout my childhood. She was (and is) an avid reader and had a saying that has stuck with me to this day: <br><br>
       <p class="quote"><strong><em>Everyone is a reader. You just have to find the genre of book that opens that door for them. <br>And then, they'll never stop reading.</em></strong></p><br> I firmly agree with this idea.
       Below are some textbooks that I've enjoyed (yes, enjoyed) reading and would highly recommend to anyone interested in aerodynamics, turbulence, turbulence modeling,
       or computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
    </p><br>
    <li>Cummings, et. al. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/kr/academic/subjects/engineering/aerospace-engineering/applied-computational-aerodynamics-modern-engineering-approach">Applied Computational Aerodynamics: A Modern Engineering Approach</a>,
      Cambridge University Press, 2015.
      <ul>
        <li><em>This textbook provides clear and concise information about the state of computational aerodynamics (CA), its applications, and its importance.
            It's a very pleasant read for anyone aspiring to learn CA.</em></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Davidson, P.A. <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/turbulence-9780198722595?cc=kr&lang=en&">Turbulence: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers</a>, Oxford Universoty Press, 2015.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Another rather enjoyable book that discusses all of the ins and outs of turbulence. Its not exactly for the faint of heart, but it's well worth
          a read.</em></li>
