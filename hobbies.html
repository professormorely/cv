    <li>Video Games<br>
      <p>
        I've played video games since I was a little kid. As an only child, they offered endless hours of fun.<br>
        As I grew older, they offered a way for me to make friends outside of my hometown and across the world<br>
        and introduced me to the idea of constant and consistent improvement.<br>
        Since high school, I have almost exclusively played video games with high skill curves. In high school,<br>
        it that came first in the form of GunZ the Duel, a glitchy and twitch third person shooter, and Starcraft,<br>
        which was argueably the first real eSport. I still enjoy playing both games, though these days I mainly<br>
        play the original Starcraft's successor, Starcraft 2, with friends back in the US.

    <li>Reading</li>
      <p>
        As a kid, my other most beloved hobby was reading. As an adult, I try my best to expose myself to new books;<br>
        so much so that I often find myself biting off more than I can chew. These days, I spend almost all of my <br>
        free time in lab working on my research, often until 10-10:30 at night. It has been difficult for me to pick <br>
        up new books and finish them as I would prefer to read after getting back to my dormitory, but I get back so <br>
        late that I never have time to devote to reading. Here's a list of the books I'm working on at the moment:
        <ol>
          <li><em>A Promised Land</em> by Barack Obama</li>
          <li><em>Arrival</em> by Ted Chieng</li>
          <li><em>Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell</em> by Susanna Clarke</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li>I also run a fashion and lifestyle blog, though I haven't been dedicating any time to it recently...</li>
